# Jarren's Webpage-Mockup
Period 7 || 9/22/2017

Welcome to my First Quarter Webpage-Mockup!

For this mockup, I had to attempt to recreate https://soundcloud.com/ through my current knowledge of HTML5 and CSS syntax.  

When I started off the website, I knew that I was not going to find every single bits of current image on the website. 

So, what I decided, was to add a bit of my own flavor of images and formatting whilst still maintaining the structure of Soundcloud the way it was as of September 16th, 2017. 

Through this project, I learned a variety of CSS properties (such as opacity, display, z-index, etc.) and tuned up a bit on my use of <divs> in HTML5. 

Starting from scratch, I personally took a fairly long while to create the page. I believe I spent like a whole Saturday dedicated to this project since it was so lengthy: searched for images, understanding important situations in where I need to place certain divs, properly lining up the song images in display blocks, and other such HTML & CSS things you could find in my code.

Before this whole coding process ensued, I selected SoundCloud (instead of the usual Google home screen) because I wanted to make a unique webpage-mockup apart from the individuals in my class as well as learn new things in the process. 

At first glance, SoundCloud appeared as a relatively simple formatted website project and I kind of already knew no-one was going to recreate it. When I did end up creating it, I felt my brain was fully blown out with the amount of time it took, but I felt satisfied with the result. Being able to add in my own songs, instead of the ones that were shown in SoundCloud at the time, was absolutely lit. 

With the length of time given in this project, it came out in a contented fashion. Rather, I still think it would've been nice if I knew how to add a hover/active feature over the song image and have a song bit play of the corresponding song. But, I think it'll be more suitable for another time and project, or I might just come back another time. 

With that, I hope you guys enjoy my first major creation of HTML5 and CSS project I conducted. My name is Jarren Calizo, and I'm signing off ✌️✌️
